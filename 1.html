  <h2>Tuesday, February 22</h2> One thing is certain: Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, I am pressing on toward the goal.​<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/b/r1/lp-e/nwtsty/50/3#study=discover&v=50:3:13-50:3:14">—Phil. 3:13, 14.</a>

  <p>Good memories are a blessing from Jehovah; but no matter how good our life was in the past, our future in the new world will be better. Others may hurt us, but when we choose to forgive, we are able to move forward. Excessive guilt can prevent us from serving Jehovah with joy. But, like the apostle Paul, we need to believe that Jehovah has forgiven us. (1 Tim. 1:12-15) We have the prospect of living forever. And in God’s new world, we will not be plagued with regrets about the past. Regarding that time, the Bible says: “The former things will not be called to mind.” (Isa. 65:17) Just think: Some of us have grown old in Jehovah’s service, but in the new world, we will be young again. (Job 33:25) Let us, therefore, be determined not to live in the past. Rather, let us look to the future and live for what is ahead! w20.11 24 ¶4; 29 ¶18-19</p>
